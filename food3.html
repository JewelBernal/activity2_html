          <h2>What's Doner Kebab?</h2>
          <p>
            Doner kebab is a type of typical meat dish, made of meat cooked on a
            vertical skewer. The meat is usually prepared as a mixture of lamb
            and beef, but in some case it can be just beef or just chicken. The
            marinated meat pieces are mixed with some minced meat and they're
            stacked on a tall vertical spit which is turning slowly next to a
            vertical wood or coal fire. As it gets grilled, the cooked outer
            part of the cone of meat is shaved in thin slices by a huge
            sword-like knife, and arranged on a plate with Ace or flat pide
            (pitta) bread. It can be served plain as is on a plate, or put on
            white rice, or rolled in a regular bread or lavash wrap.

          <h2>How to prepare it?</h2>
          <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
          <p>
            Combine flour, oregano, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, Italian
            seasoning, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a large bowl. Add
            ground lamb and knead until thoroughly mixed together, about 3
            minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shape seasoned lamb mixture and place into a loaf pan; set on top of
            a baking sheet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bake in the preheated oven, turning halfway to ensure even browning,
            for about 1 hour and 20 minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wrap loaf in aluminum foil and let rest for about 10 minutes. Slice
            as thinly as possible to make doner kebab pieces.
