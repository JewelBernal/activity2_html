          <h2>What's Tomato Kebab?</h2>
          <p>
            Tomato kebab is served with lamb meat cooked in a broiler fire and
            served with roasted tomatoes. You can feel the acidic taste of
            tomato and the softness of lamb meat. Snacks should always be at the
            kebab table. Tomato kebab is accompanied by sumac, onion, parsley
            and bitter crushing. Besides these, we also have a wide variety of
            salads and hamlets. In addition to this delicious taste, you can
            digest your cats by drinking an ice-cold ayran and a coke. The open
            deer is very foamy and very ambitious about taste.

          <h2>What's the ingredients?</h2>
          <p>

            tablespoons a serving of soy kebab in tomato sauce 2 tablespoons

          <h2>How to prepare it?</h2>
          <p>
            Tenderloin should be cut into 1-inch-square pieces. To fit on a
            skewer and loosely wrap around the following item, quarter an onion
            and separate the curved parts. Divide a bell pepper into four parts,
            then cut each section into pieces that are each no more than an inch
            square and easily fit onto a skewer. Cut a large whole tomato into 8
            slices if you are using it in place of cherry tomatoes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Starting with the meat, alternately add the onion, pepper, mushroom,
            tomato, and other toppings, leaving a little space between each.
            Leave the mushrooms whole and skewer them through the top and the
            base. To ensure that the tomato stays on the skewer as the kebabs
            cook, choose firm sections of the tomato.
          </p>
          <p>
            The grill should be preheated to medium. When you are ready to
            grill, arrange the sticks on the grill grate, spacing them 1 to 2
            inches apart. Cook the kebabs for a few minutes on each side while
            coating them with any residual marinade and rotating them 2 to 3
            times to finish cooking all sides. Serve skewers with the limes,
            lavash, and a sprinkle of sumac.
